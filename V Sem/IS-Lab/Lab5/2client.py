'''Using socket programming in Python, demonstrate the application of hash functions
 for ensuring data integrity during transmission over a network. Write server and client
 scripts where the server computes the hash of received data and sends it back to the
 client, which then verifies the integrity of the data by comparing the received hash with
 the locally computed hash. Show how the hash verification detects data corruption 
or tampering during transmission'''
